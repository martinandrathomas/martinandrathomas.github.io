	<p id="listColor" class="listsize">The results indicate that Trap easily overcame the average J. Cole and Polo G. Trap really set himself apart by his meaningful lyrics combined with his smooth flow and delivery. It's a shame that Trap hasn't received the recognition he's worked for and so deerly deserves. A major cause of him being underground is his humble personality which other artist could truly benefit from. An added bonus for the soundcloud rapper is that his incognito lifestyle leads to a mysterious vibe to his music  </p>
