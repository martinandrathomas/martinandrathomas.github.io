		<li  class="listsize">Every word in his songs have deep and meaningful messages behind them that is camparable to no one</li>
		<li class="listsize">His voice can be desribed as a better version of Michael Jackson. Althought it does sound silly to compare his superior vocals to Michael Jackson</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="prosSize" id="listColor">Cons</p>
	<ul class="listsize">
		<li>His music has no weaknesses, he is perfect in every way</li>
